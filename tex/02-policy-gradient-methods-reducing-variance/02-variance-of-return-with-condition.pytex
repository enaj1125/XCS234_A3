Prove that $\text{Var}(R_{t+1}) \geq \text{Var}(R_{t})$ is true if we assume that $r_{t+1}$ is, on average, correlated with the previous rewards, i.e. $\frac{1}{t+1} \sum_{i=0}^t \text{Cov}(r_i, r_{t+1}) > 0$.

You may find the following properties helpful in proving this result:
	$$Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2Cov(X,Y)$$ 
	$$Cov(X+Y, Z) = Cov(X, Z) + Cov(Y, Z)$$

\textit{Hint: Try to write the expression for the return at a given timestep as a sum of rewards.}
