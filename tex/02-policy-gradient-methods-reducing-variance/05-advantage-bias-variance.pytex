Let us define $\hat{A}_t^{(k)} = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \gamma^i \delta^{\hat{V}}_{t + i}$. Show that $\hat{A}_t^{(k)} =  - \hat{V}(s_t) + \gamma^k \hat{V}(s_{t+k}) + \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \gamma^i r_{t+i}$. \\

In general, how does bias and variance change as $k$ increases? A few sentences of justification will suffice when describing the changes in variance and bias as we increase $k$, no formal proof is necessary.

\textit{Hint: if you expand the expression for $\hat{A}_t^{(k)}$ you should observe a telescoping sum which can help simplify your proof for the first part of this question.}
